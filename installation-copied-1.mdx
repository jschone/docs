Peanuts is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can install it directly from your browser - **no app store required**. Once installed, it works just like a native app with its own icon on your home screen.

<Info>
  Peanuts automatically detects your device and shows the right instructions. Visit [peanutsapp.com/install](https://peanutsapp.com/install) on your device to get started.
