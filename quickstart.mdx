## The Onboarding Experience

After signing in for the first time, you'll be guided through a quick onboarding flow.

<Frame caption="Welcome screen introducing Peanuts' core concepts">
  ![Onboarding welcome screen](/images/quickstart/onboarding-welcome.png)
</Frame>

The onboarding explains three key things:

1. **Just describe what you need** - No setup required. AI creates it for you.
2. **Track habits, logs, ideas-anything** - From expenses to workouts to mood.
3. **Get insights over time** - See patterns and stay on track.

Click **Let's get started** to create your first helper.

## Create Your First Helper

This is where the magic happens. You can create a helper in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language (Recommended)">
    Simply describe what you want to track in plain English.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Type your request">
        In the text input, describe what you want to track. Be conversational-Peanuts understands natural language.

        **Example prompts:**

        - "Track my daily water intake"
        - "Log my expenses"
        - "Remember to take my medication"
        - "Rate my mood each day"

        <Frame>
          ![Typing a helper description](/images/quickstart/describe-helper.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wait for AI generation">
        Peanuts AI will analyze your request and create a customized helper with:

        - Appropriate input fields
        - Smart widgets (streaks, timers, charts)
        - Validation rules
        - A matching icon and color theme

        <Frame caption="AI generating your helper configuration">
          ![AI thinking animation](/images/quickstart/ai-generating.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review your helper">
        You'll see a live preview of your helper with all its components. The AI also provides an explanation of what it created and why.

        <Frame>
          ![Generated helper preview](/images/quickstart/helper-preview.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Save and start using">
        Click **Create Helper** to save. You'll see a celebration animation, and then you'll be taken to your home screen where your new helper is ready to use!
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Quick Templates">
    If you prefer to start with a pre-built option, tap **Need ideas?** to see quick templates:

    | Template      | Description          | Best For                |
    | ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
    | 💸 Spending   | Track what you spend | Daily expense logging   |
    | 💊 Medication | Never double up      | Medication adherence    |
    | 💪 Workouts   | Build the habit      | Exercise tracking       |
    | 😊 Mood       | Spot patterns        | Mental health awareness |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My helper didn't generate correctly">
    Try being more specific in your description. Instead of "track stuff," say "track my daily water intake in glasses."

    You can also refine your helper after creation using the **Tweak** button or natural language chat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I can't create more helpers">
    Free accounts are limited to 3 active helpers. You can either:

    - Delete an existing helper to make room
    - Pause helpers you're not actively using
    - [Upgrade to a paid plan](/pricing) for higher limits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My entry didn't save">
    Check that all required fields are filled in (marked with red). If using voice entry, ensure your microphone permissions are enabled.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The AI asked me clarifying questions">
    This is normal! When your request could be interpreted multiple ways, Peanuts asks follow-up questions to create the best helper for your needs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
