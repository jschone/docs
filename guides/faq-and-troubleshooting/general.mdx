## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Peanuts?">
    Peanuts is your personal tracking assistant—a tool that helps you log, organize, and understand the things that matter to you. Whether it's expenses, workouts, habits, or any routine, Peanuts creates simple "helpers" that capture your data through text, voice, or photos.
    
    Think of it as a smart notebook that:
    - Understands what you're logging naturally
    - Works across web, mobile, and Telegram
    - Gives you insights from your patterns over time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need to download an app?">
    No app store download required! Peanuts is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that installs directly from your browser. Visit [peanutsapp.com](https://peanutsapp.com), sign up, and tap "Add to Home Screen" for the full app experience.
    
    See our [Installation Guide](/tutorials/installation) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is Peanuts free?">
    Yes! The Free plan includes:
    - Up to 3 helpers
    - 50 AI credits per month
    - Basic voice entry
    - Web and mobile access
    
    Paid plans unlock unlimited helpers, more credits, advanced features like webhooks, and priority support. See [Pricing](/pricing) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's a 'helper'?">
    A helper is your personal tracking tool for a specific purpose—like an expense tracker, workout log, or reading list. Each helper has:
    - Custom fields tailored to what you're tracking
    - A unique command (e.g., `/expenses`)
    - Optional widgets for stats and charts
    
    You describe what you want to track, and Peanuts creates a helper automatically.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How many helpers can I create?">
    | Plan | Helpers |
    |------|---------|
    | Free | 3 |
    | Starter | 10 |
    | Pro | Unlimited |
    | Team | Unlimited |
  </Accordion>

## Account & Billing

<AccordionGroup>

    Currently, email addresses cannot be changed directly. To use a different email:
    1. Create a new account with your preferred email

    3. Select **Cancel Subscription**
    
    Your access continues until the end of your billing period. You can resubscribe anytime.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to my data if I downgrade?">
    Your data is never deleted when downgrading. However:
    - If you exceed the helper limit, you won't be able to create new helpers
    - Existing helpers remain accessible
    - Premium features (webhooks, advanced voice) become unavailable
    
    Upgrade anytime to regain full access.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I delete my account?">
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Account**
    2. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
    3. Click **Delete Account**

## Credits & Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are credits?">
    Credits are used for AI-powered features like:
    - Voice transcription (10 credits)
    - Text-to-speech (15 credits)
    - AI parsing and insights (1 credit)
    - Image analysis/Smart Scan (5 credits)
    
    Credits reset monthly based on your billing cycle.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I ran out of credits. What now?">
    Options when credits are exhausted:
    1. **Wait for reset** — Credits refresh monthly
    2. **Buy a top-up** — One-time credit packs at Settings → Credits
    3. **Upgrade your plan** — Higher tiers include more credits
    
    Basic features (manual entry, viewing data) work without credits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why did my credits disappear?">
    Credits reset to your plan's allowance each billing cycle—they don't roll over. Check your reset date at **Settings** → **Credits**.
    
    If credits dropped unexpectedly mid-cycle, check your **Usage History** for recent AI operations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How can I use fewer credits?">
    Tips to conserve credits:
    - Use text entry instead of voice when convenient
    - Disable "Read Aloud" in Ask Peanuts
    - Use Quick Voice instead of Hands-Free Mode
    - Batch similar entries instead of logging one at a time
  </Accordion>

## Telegram Integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I connect Telegram?">
    See our complete guide: [Connect Telegram](/tutorials/connect-telegram)
    
    Quick steps:
    1. Create a bot via @BotFather

    3. Add it in Peanuts Settings → Telegram
    4. Start a chat with your bot and send `/start`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My bot isn't responding">

    Common issues:

## App & Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The app is slow or unresponsive">
    Try these fixes:
    1. **Clear cache** — Settings → Clear App Cache
    2. **Update the app** — Reinstall from browser
    3. **Check connection** — Slow internet affects sync
    4. **Reduce data** — Archive old entries if you have thousands
    5. **Use a modern browser** — Chrome/Safari work best
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data isn't syncing">
    Sync issues are usually connectivity-related:
    1. Check internet connection
    2. Pull down to refresh

    **In Peanuts:**
    - Settings → Notifications → Enable push
    - Check Quiet Hours settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I see a blank white screen">
    This usually indicates a loading error:
    1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

    4. Try a different browser
