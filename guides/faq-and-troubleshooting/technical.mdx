</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Free tier history limit">

    **Solution:** Upgrade to Starter (30 days) or Pro (unlimited) to see older entries.

### Messages Not Creating Entries

<AccordionGroup>

    **Solution:**
    1. Use `/helpers` to see available helpers
    2. Tap on a helper to select it
    3. Or use the helper command directly (e.g., `/expenses`)

    3. Use the helper's expected format
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Credits exhausted">

## Webhook & Integration Errors

### Webhook Not Triggering

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook not enabled">
    **Solution:**
    1. Open your helper's settings
    2. Go to the **Integrations** tab
    3. Enable **Webhooks**
    4. Enter a valid webhook URL
    5. Save changes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Invalid webhook URL">
    **Cause:** URL is malformed or unreachable.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Verify the URL starts with `https://`
    2. Test the URL is accessible from the internet
    3. Check for typos
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Receiving server issues">
    **Cause:** Your server is returning errors.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Check your server logs for errors
    2. Ensure endpoint returns 200 OK quickly
    3. Review the **Webhook History** tab for error messages
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Signature Verification Failing

**Cause:** Mismatch between expected and computed signatures.

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Using the correct webhook secret (found in Integrations settings)
2. ✅ Using raw request body (not parsed JSON)
3. ✅ Using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm
4. ✅ Comparing hex-encoded signature
5. ✅ Using constant-time comparison function

```javascript
// Correct signature verification
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload, 'utf8') // Use raw payload string
    .digest('hex');
  
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expected)
  );
}
```

### Webhook Deliveries Failing

Check the **Webhook History** in your helper's Integrations tab for:

| Status Code | Meaning | Solution |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Timeout** | Server took too long | Return 200 immediately, process async |
| **4xx** | Client error | Check your endpoint's validation |
| **5xx** | Server error | Check your server logs |
| **SSL Error** | Certificate issue | Ensure valid SSL certificate |

<Tip>
  Peanuts retries failed webhooks up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 30min).
</Tip>
