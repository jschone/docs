### Credit Costs

| Operation | Credits | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Text AI** | 1 | AI chat, helper creation, smart nudges |
| **Vision AI** | 5 | Receipt scanning, smart scan, image analysis |
| **Speech-to-Text** | 10 | Voice entry, hands-free mode |
| **Text-to-Speech** | 15 | Voice readback, audio responses |

### Credit Reset Cycle

<Note>
  Credits reset **monthly** on your billing date. Unused credits do **not** roll over to the next month.
</Note>

### Monitoring Your Credits

Track your credit usage in two ways:

1. **Header Counter** — Quick glance at remaining credits from any page
2. **Credits Usage Dashboard** — Detailed breakdown at `/settings/credits`

The dashboard shows:
- Remaining credits and usage percentage
