Welcome to Peanuts! This tutorial walks you through creating your first helper—from idea to working app in under 2 minutes.

<Info>

## Create Your First Helper

### Step 1: Describe What You Need

From your dashboard, tap **Create Helper** and describe what you want to track in plain language.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good Examples" icon="check">
    - "Track my daily water intake"
    - "Log my workout sessions"
    - "Keep a list of books I want to read"
    - "Morning routine checklist"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tips" icon="lightbulb">
    - Be specific about what you're tracking
    - Mention if it's daily, one-time, or ongoing
    - Include details you want to capture
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example:** Let's create a mood tracker.

Track my daily mood with a rating and notes about what affected it

### Step 2: Review the Preview

Peanuts instantly generates a helper based on your description:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What you'll see" icon="eye">
    - **Name & Icon** — Auto-generated, editable
    - **Fields** — Data you'll capture (mood rating, notes)
    - **Template** — The type of helper (tracker, list, etc.)
    - **Theme** — Colors matched to your topic
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What you can change" icon="pen">
    - Rename the helper
    - Add or remove fields
    - Change the icon and colors
    - Adjust field settings (required, options)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Don't worry about getting it perfect. You can always edit your helper later—Peanuts makes refinement easy.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Save Your Helper

Happy with the preview? Tap **Save Helper** to create it.

Your helper now appears on your dashboard, ready to use.
