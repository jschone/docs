## Step 1: Create Your Bot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open BotFather">
    In Telegram, search for **@BotFather** or tap [this link](https://t.me/BotFather). This is Telegram's official bot for creating new bots.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a new bot">
    Send the command:
    ```
    /newbot
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your bot">
    BotFather asks for a display name. Choose something like:
    - "My Peanuts"
    - "Personal Tracker"
    - "Life Log"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a username">
    BotFather needs a unique username ending in `bot`. Examples:
    - `mylife_peanuts_bot`
    - `jsmith_tracker_bot`
    - `personal_log_2024_bot`
    
    <Tip>
    If your first choice is taken, add numbers or underscores to make it unique.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy your token">
    BotFather responds with your **bot token**—a long string like:
    ```
    123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ
    ```
    Copy this token. You'll need it in the next step.
    
    <Warning>
    Keep this token private! Anyone with it can control your bot.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 2: Connect to Peanuts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Telegram Settings">
    In Peanuts, navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Telegram**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your bot token">
    Paste the token from BotFather into the token field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connect">
    Peanuts verifies your bot and sets up the connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start chatting">
    Open your new bot in Telegram and send `/start` to activate it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Once connected, you'll see a confirmation with your bot's username. The bot is now ready to receive messages.
</Info>

---

## Step 3: Authorize Your Chat

For security, your bot only responds to authorized chats.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send /start to your bot">
    Open your bot in Telegram and send:
    ```
    /start
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bot sends authorization code">
    Your bot responds with a 6-digit code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter code in Peanuts">
    Back in Peanuts Telegram Settings, enter the code to authorize this chat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You're connected!">
    The bot confirms: "✅ Authorized! You can now send entries."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Entry

Try sending a message to your bot:

Spent €12.50 on lunch

**What happens:**
1. Bot receives your message
2. AI identifies it as an expense
3. Bot asks: "Save to /expenses?" (or auto-routes if you have a rule)
4. You confirm
5. Entry is saved with amount, category, and timestamp

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text Messages" icon="message">
    ```
    Mood is 7 today, feeling productive
    ```
    ```
    Finished reading Atomic Habits
    ```
    ```
    Weight: 73.2kg
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Voice Notes" icon="microphone">
    Record a voice note describing your entry. Peanuts transcribes and parses it automatically.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Send Photos

Photos are automatically analyzed:

| Photo Type | What Happens |
|------------|--------------|
| **Receipt** | Extracts merchant, amount, date |
| **Document** | OCR extracts text content |
| **Product** | Identifies item for collections |
| **Screenshot** | Reads text from the image |

**Example:** Send a photo of a restaurant receipt → Bot extracts "Lunch at Mario's, €24.50" → Saves to your expense tracker.

---

## Bot Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/start` | Initialize or re-authorize the bot |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/apps` | List your helpers |
| `/today` | See today's entries |
| `/stats` | Quick summary of recent activity |
| `/routing` | Manage auto-routing rules |

<Tip>
Send `/apps` to see all your helpers. You can then specify where to save by starting a message with the helper command (e.g., `/expenses 15 coffee`).
</Tip>

---

## Smart Routing

Tired of confirming where to save each message? Set up automatic routing.

### How It Works

1. **Pattern matching** — "allrecipes.com links → /recipes"
2. **Content type** — "All photos → /receipts"
3. **Learning** — After 3 manual selections, bot suggests a rule

### Set Up a Rule

Via Telegram:
/routing


Or in the web app: **Settings → Telegram → Smart Routing**

| Rule Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Domain** | Links from netflix.com → /watchlist |
| **Keyword** | Messages with "workout" → /exercise |
| **Content** | All voice notes → /journal |
| **Time** | Morning messages → /morning-routine |

<Info>
Smart routing learns from your behavior. If you manually select the same helper 3 times for similar content, the bot suggests creating an automatic rule.
</Info>

---

## The Mini App

Your bot includes a full web interface accessible from Telegram:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tap 'Open My Apps'">
    In any bot message, tap the button or send `/start`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Full interface opens">
    A mini app appears with your dashboard, helpers, and full editing capabilities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use just like the web app">
    Add entries, edit helpers, view stats—all without leaving Telegram.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Reminders & Digests

### Set Reminders

Via Telegram:

/remind Take vitamins at 8am daily

/remind Check expenses every Sunday at 6pm

### Daily Digests

Get morning and evening summaries:
- **Morning digest** — Yesterday's summary, today's agenda
- **Evening digest** — Today's entries, streaks, and stats

Configure in **Settings → Telegram → Digests** or send `/settings` to your bot.
