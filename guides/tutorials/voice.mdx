## Quick Voice Entry

The fastest way to log data by voice.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Helper">
    Navigate to any helper where you want to add an entry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tap the Microphone">
    Look for the mic button next to the "Add Entry" button or in the input area.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Speak Naturally">
    Describe your entry in plain language:
    - *"Spent forty-five dollars on groceries at Whole Foods"*
    - *"Ran 5k in 28 minutes this morning"*
    - *"Met with Sarah about Q3 planning, went well"*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Confirm">
    Peanuts shows what it understood. Check the parsed fields, then tap **Add** to save or **Edit** to adjust.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Speak in complete thoughts. "Coffee meeting with Tom, $12, downtown café" works better than fragmented phrases.
</Tip>

### What Gets Parsed

Peanuts automatically extracts:

- **Numbers** → Amount, quantity, duration fields
- **Dates/Times** → Date fields (today, yesterday, next Monday)
- **Categories** → Select fields with matching options
- **Descriptions** → Text fields

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example: Expense Tracker">

    **Peanuts parses:**
    - Amount: $62.00
    - Category: Meals
    - Description: Lunch with the team
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example: Workout Log">

    - Sets: 3
    - Reps: 8
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Hands-Free Mode

A full conversational experience-perfect when you can't touch your phone.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Hands-Free Mode">
    Tap the **hands-free icon** (headphones) in your helper's action bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Listen for the Prompt">
    Peanuts speaks: *"Ready to log. What would you like to add?"*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Speak Your Entry">
    Describe what you want to log naturally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm by Voice">
    Peanuts reads back what it understood and asks for confirmation:
    - Say **"Yes"** or **"Confirm"** to save
    - Say **"Edit"** to make changes
    - Say **"Cancel"** to discard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue or Exit">
    After saving, Peanuts asks if you want to add another. Say **"Done"** to exit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Conversation Flow

```
🎧 Peanuts: "Ready to log. What would you like to add?"

🎤 You: "Twenty dollars on an Uber to the airport"

🎧 Peanuts: "Got it. Twenty dollars for Uber, category Transport. 
             Should I save this?"

🎤 You: "Yes"

🎧 Peanuts: "Done. Anything else?"

🎤 You: "No, that's all"

🎧 Peanuts: "All set. Have a safe trip!"
```

<Note>
Hands-Free Mode uses both speech-to-text (10 credits) and text-to-speech (15 credits) per interaction.
</Note>

### Visual Feedback

Even in hands-free mode, you get visual cues:

- **Pulsing waveform** → Peanuts is listening
- **Processing spinner** → Transcribing your speech
- **Confirmation card** → Shows parsed data before saving

## Voice Tips & Best Practices

  <Card title="Do" icon="check">
    - Speak clearly at normal pace
    - Use complete sentences
    - Include units ("dollars", "minutes", "miles")
    - Mention category names from your helper
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid" icon="xmark">
    - Speaking too fast or mumbling
    - Background noise (TV, crowds)
    - Very short fragments
    - Uncommon abbreviations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Natural Phrasing Examples

| Instead of... | Try... |
|--------------|--------|

| "Meeting Bob" | "Had a meeting with Bob about sales" |

### Handling Mistakes

If Peanuts misunderstands:

1. **Quick Voice**: Tap **Edit** to correct before saving

3. **After saving**: Edit the entry normally from the list
