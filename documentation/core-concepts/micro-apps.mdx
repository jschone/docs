<Info>
  In Peanuts, we call them **Helpers**: small, focused tools that help you track, log, and manage specific parts of your life. Internally, they're powered by a flexible micro-app system.

## What is a Helper?

A Helper is a personalized mini-application that Peanuts creates for you based on a simple description of what you need. Unlike traditional apps that try to do everything, each Helper focuses on one specific task.

## How Helpers Work

When you describe what you need, like "remind me to take my meds" or "track my daily spending" Peanuts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understands Your Intent">
    AI analyzes your description and identifies the core purpose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classifies the Pattern">
    Maps your need to one of several archetypes (tracker, checklist, habit, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generates the Structure">
    Creates appropriate fields, widgets, and enforcement rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Applies Smart Defaults">
    Adds domain-specific features like cooldowns for medication or streak tracking for habits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Helper Types

Behind the scenes, Helpers are based on **archetypes**, patterns that define how data is collected and displayed:

| Archetype      | Best For                   | Example                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Log**        | Recording things over time | Expense tracker, mood journal    |
| **Tracker**    | Counting and metrics       | Water intake, step counter       |
| **Habit**      | Daily consistency          | Medication, workout routine      |
| **Checklist**  | Items to complete          | Shopping list, safety checks     |
| **Collection** | Saving items for later     | Recipe book, reading list        |
| **Schedule**   | Time-bound events          | Weekly meal plan, appointments   |
| **Plan**       | Multi-step projects        | Trip planning, party prep        |
| **Visualizer** | AI-powered previews        | Virtual wardrobe, color previews |

<Tip>
  You don't need to choose an archetype, just describe what you need, and Peanuts picks the right one automatically.
</Tip>
