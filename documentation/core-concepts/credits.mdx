Peanuts uses a **credit-based system** to manage AI-powered features. Credits are consumed when you use AI capabilities like Ask Peanuts, Smart Scan, or voice features.

## Credit Costs

Different AI operations consume different amounts of credits:

| Operation | Credits | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Text AI** | 1 | Helper creation, Ask Peanuts queries, AI chat |
| **Vision AI** | 5 | Receipt scanning, Smart Scan, image analysis |
| **Speech-to-Text** | 10 | Voice input transcription |
| **Text-to-Speech** | 15 | Having responses read aloud |

<Note>
**Virtual Try-On** uses a separate monthly counter, not credits. See your plan for included try-ons.
</Note>

## Monthly Allowances by Plan

| Plan | Monthly Credits | Virtual Try-Ons | Helpers |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Free** | 50 | 0 | 3 |
| **Starter** | 200 | 0 | 10 |
| **Pro** | 500 | 10 | Unlimited |
| **Team** | 1,000 | 25 | Unlimited |

Credits reset at the beginning of each billing cycle. Unused credits do not roll over.

## Checking Your Balance

### Header Counter

The credit counter in the app header shows your current balance:

- **Green**: Plenty of credits remaining
- **Yellow**: Running low (10 or fewer)
- **Red**: Critical (3 or fewer)

## Low Credit Notifications

Peanuts sends email notifications when your credits run low:

| Threshold | Notification |
|-----------|--------------|
| 10 credits | Gentle reminder |
| 5 credits | Warning |
| 3 credits | Urgent alert |
| 1 credit | Final notice |

<Tip>
You can disable these notifications in **Settings → Notifications → Low-credit email alerts**.
</Tip>

## Running Out of Credits

When you run out of credits:

1. **AI features pause** - Ask Peanuts, voice input, and Smart Scan won't work
2. **Core features continue** - Manual data entry, viewing entries, and widgets still work
3. **Prompt to recharge** - You'll see options to upgrade or buy credit packs

## Buying More Credits

### Upgrade Your Plan

The most cost-effective way to get more credits is upgrading:

- **Starter → Pro**: 2.5x more credits (200 → 500)
- **Pro → Team**: 2x more credits (500 → 1,000)
