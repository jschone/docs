## What is Ask Peanuts?

Ask Peanuts is an AI-powered assistant that has complete knowledge of everything you've recorded in your helpers. Unlike generic AI chatbots, Peanuts only knows what you've actually logged-it never makes up information or hallucinates data.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Think of it as having a personal analyst who has read every single entry across all your helpers and can instantly recall patterns, trends, and specific details.

      ![Ask Peanuts floating button](/images/concepts/ask-peanuts-button.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Your Question">
    Type your question naturally. Peanuts understands context and time references:

    - "What did I log today?"
    - "How much did I spend this week?"
    - "Show me entries from last month"
    - "Did I take my vitamins yesterday?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get an Answer">
    Peanuts searches your data using semantic understanding and returns a focused answer based solely on what you've recorded.

    <Tip>
      Peanuts will cite the date and helper for each piece of data it references, so you always know where the information came from.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue the Conversation">
    Ask follow-up questions in the same session. Peanuts remembers the context of your conversation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Time-Aware Queries

Peanuts understands natural language time references:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Relative Dates">
    - "today", "yesterday", "this morning"
    - "this week", "last week"
    - "this month", "last month"
    - "last 7 days", "past 2 weeks"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specific Periods">
    - "in January", "during March"
    - "last 30 days"
    - "past 3 months"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example Queries">
    - "How much did I spend yesterday?"
    - "What was my average sleep last week?"
    - "Show me all entries from January"
    - "Did I exercise in the past 5 days?"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Semantic Search

Ask Peanuts uses **semantic search** to find relevant entries-not just keyword matching. This means:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding Intent">
    If you ask "how am I sleeping?", Peanuts will find entries from sleep-related helpers even if you never used the word "sleeping" in your entries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contextual Relevance">
    Peanuts prioritizes entries that are semantically related to your question. A query about "fitness progress" will surface workout, weight, and activity entries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cross-Helper Discovery">
    Semantic search works across all your helpers, so you can ask questions that span multiple types of data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Business Knowledge Base Integration

<Note>
  **Pro Feature**: Business Knowledge Base is available on the Pro plan.
</Note>

If you've uploaded documents to the Business Knowledge Base (pricelists, catalogs, service descriptions), Peanuts can reference this information when answering questions.

<Frame>
  ![Business Knowledge Base](/images/concepts/knowledge-base.png)
</Frame>

### Supported Document Types

| Type   | Extensions              | Best For                      |

| Excel  | `.xlsx`, `.xls`         | Price tables, inventory lists |
| CSV    | `.csv`                  | Data exports, price lists     |
| Images | `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp` | Scanned documents, receipts   |
| Text   | `.txt`                  | Notes, descriptions           |

### How It Works

1. Upload documents in **Settings \> Business Knowledge Base**
2. Peanuts automatically processes and learns from them
3. When you ask questions, Peanuts can cite information from your documents

<Tip>
  When Peanuts uses information from your uploaded documents, it will cite the source document name and page number (if applicable).
</Tip>

## Example Conversations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Health Tracking">
    **You**: Did I take my meds yesterday?

    **Peanuts**: Yes! I found an entry in your "Daily Meds" helper from yesterday at 8:15 AM. You logged: Vitamin D, Omega-3, and Multivitamin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Expense Analysis">
    **You**: How much did I spend on food this week?

    **Peanuts**: Based on your "Expenses" helper, you spent \$156.40 on food this week:

    - Groceries: \$89.20 (Monday)
    - Lunch: \$12.50 (Tuesday)
    - Dinner out: \$54.70 (Friday)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Habit Insights">
    **You**: Am I exercising more this month compared to last month?

    **Peanuts**: Looking at your "Workout Log" helper: You've logged 12 workouts so far this month (we're on day 20), compared to 8 total workouts last month. That's a 50% increase in frequency. Great progress!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cross-Helper Correlation">
    **You**: On days I sleep well, how's my productivity?

    **Peanuts**: Interesting pattern! When you log 7+ hours of sleep in your "Sleep Tracker", your "Daily Tasks" helper shows an average of 8.2 tasks completed. On days with less than 6 hours, you complete an average of 4.5 tasks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Peanuts says 'I don't have a record of that'">
    This means there's no data matching your query. Make sure you've been logging relevant information in your helpers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Answers seem incomplete">
    Try being more specific with time ranges. Instead of "show me my expenses", try "show me my expenses from this week."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't access Ask Peanuts">
    Ask Peanuts requires a Starter plan or above. Free tier users will see an upgrade prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Out of credits">
    Each query uses 1 AI credit. Check your credit balance in the header or go to Settings \> Credits to top up.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Voice input not working">
    Ensure you've granted microphone permissions in your browser. Try refreshing the page and clicking the microphone button again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
