<Info>
  **Smart Scan uses AI credits.** Each image scan costs 1 AI credit. See [Credits](/concepts/credits) for details on usage and limits.
</Info>

Smart Scan uses advanced AI vision to recognize multiple items from a single photo and automatically populate your helper's data fields. Take a picture of your fridge, toolbox, wine collection, or parts bin — Peanuts identifies everything and adds it to your inventory in seconds.

</Frame>

## How It Works

Smart Scan is **context-aware** — it reads your helper's name, description, and fields to understand exactly what to look for and how to categorize items.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Take a Photo">
    Tap the Smart Scan field and take a photo or upload an existing image
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Analyzes">
    Gemini Vision AI identifies all visible items based on your helper's context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    A dialog shows all detected items — edit, select, or deselect as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm & Add">
    Selected items are bulk-added to your helper with all fields populated
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Domain Intelligence

Smart Scan automatically adapts its recognition based on your helper's **domain**. This ensures more accurate and relevant results.

## Using Smart Scan

### Taking a Good Photo

For best results, follow these tips:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lighting" icon="sun">
    Use bright, even lighting. Avoid shadows and glare.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Angle" icon="camera">
    Photograph items straight-on so labels and text are readable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Spacing" icon="grip">
    Spread items apart slightly so AI can distinguish each one.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Focus" icon="bullseye">
    Ensure the image is sharp and in focus, especially on labels.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### The Scan Interface

<Frame>
  ![Smart Scan upload area](/images/features/smart-scan-interface.png)
</Frame>

The Smart Scan field appears with:

- **Camera icon** — Tap to take a photo or upload
- **AI Scan badge** — Indicates this is an AI-powered feature
- **Drag & drop zone** — On desktop, drag images directly into the field

### Review & Edit Dialog

After scanning, a dialog presents all detected items:

<Frame>
  ![Smart Scan results dialog with items](/images/features/smart-scan-results.png)
</Frame>

| Feature              | Description                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Source thumbnail** | Shows the scanned image for reference |
| **Item checkboxes**  | Select/deselect items to include      |
| **Select all/none**  | Bulk selection controls               |
| **Edit button**      | Expand to edit any field value        |
| **Add button**       | Confirm and add selected items        |

<Tip>
  Tap the **pencil icon** on any item to expand its fields for editing before adding.
</Tip>

## Field Mapping

Smart Scan intelligently maps extracted data to your helper's fields:

| Field Type   | AI Extraction Behavior                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**     | Extracts names, descriptions, brands              |
| **Number**   | Extracts quantities, amounts, numeric values only |
| **Select**   | Matches to the closest available option           |
| **Date**     | Extracts dates in YYYY-MM-DD format               |
| **Checkbox** | Returns true/false based on presence              |

<Note>
  Image fields are not populated by Smart Scan — the scan replaces the need for individual photos.
</Note>

## Custom Scan Hints

For specialized use cases, helpers can include a **scan hint** that provides additional instructions to the AI.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Wine Collection">
    ```
    "Identify wine bottles, read labels for name, vintage, and region"
    ```

    Result: AI focuses on extracting wine-specific details from bottle labels.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Auto Parts">
    ```
    "Identify parts, read part numbers, note condition"
    ```

    Result: AI prioritizes finding manufacturer part numbers and assessing condition.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Medication Cabinet">
    ```
    "Identify medications, note dosages and expiry dates if visible"
    ```

    Result: AI carefully reads small print for dosage information.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Credit Usage

<Warning>
  Each Smart Scan analysis uses **1 AI credit**, regardless of how many items are found.
</Warning>

Credit is deducted **after** successful analysis, not when you cancel or the scan fails.

| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Successful scan          | 1 credit    |
