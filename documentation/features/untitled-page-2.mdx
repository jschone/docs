    Go to your helper's integrations settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Scheduled PDF Report">
    Toggle on the scheduled report option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure delivery">
    Set three options:

    - **Recipient email** - Where to send the report

    - **Time** - What time to send (in your timezone)

### What Gets Sent

The weekly email includes:

- **Summary stats** - Entry count, totals, and averages for the past 7 days
- **Recent entries table** - Up to 10 entries with key field values

  <Accordion title="Email not received">
    **Check for:**
