## Quick Voice Entry

Quick Voice Entry is the fastest way to log data by voice. Speak naturally, and AI extracts the relevant information from your speech.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tap the voice button">
    Look for the **"Add by voice"** button on any helper that supports it. It appears near the add form.

    <Frame>
      ![Voice entry button](/images/features/voice-entry-button.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Speak your entry">
    When the button turns red and shows **"Stop"**, speak naturally. For example:

    > "Spent forty-two dollars at Whole Foods on groceries"

    The button will pulse while recording.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    After you stop, you'll see two processing states:

    - **"Listening..."** - Transcribing your speech to text
    - **"Understanding..."** - AI parsing your text into structured fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and confirm">
    A confirmation dialog appears showing:

    - Your **raw transcription** (exactly what you said)
    - **Parsed fields** with extracted values
    - **Confidence badges** on successfully filled fields
    - **"Held" warnings** if required fields are missing

    <Frame>
      ![Voice confirmation dialog](/images/features/voice-confirm-dialog.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add, edit, or cancel">
    Choose your action:

    - **Add** - Confirms the entry as-is
    - **Edit** - Opens the full form with pre-filled values
    - **Cancel** - Discards the entry
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Natural Speech Examples

Speak naturally - the AI understands context and extracts the right data:

| What You Say                               | Fields Extracted                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Coffee at Starbucks, five twenty"         | **Amount:** 5.20, **Description:** Coffee, **Merchant:** Starbucks |
| "Ran three miles in twenty-eight minutes"  | **Distance:** 3, **Duration:** 28, **Activity:** Running           |
| "Call mom tomorrow at 2pm"                 | **Task:** Call mom, **Date:** tomorrow, **Time:** 2:00 PM          |
| "Feeling tired today, slept about 6 hours" | **Mood:** tired, **Sleep:** 6                                      |

<Tip>
  Include as much detail as you want in a single breath - the AI will match your words to the available fields.
</Tip>

## Hands-Free Mode

Hands-Free Mode creates a full conversational loop between you and Peanuts - perfect when you can't look at or touch your screen.

<Frame>
  ![Hands-free mode interface](/images/features/hands-free-mode.png)
</Frame>

### When to Use Hands-Free Mode

- 🚗 **Driving** - Log expenses or notes without touching your phone
- 🍳 **Cooking** - Track ingredients or recipe notes with messy hands
- 🏃 **Exercising** - Record workout data mid-session
- 👶 **Multitasking** - When your hands are literally full

### The Conversation Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Hands-Free Mode">
    Tap the **headphones icon** on supported helpers to launch the full-screen hands-free interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tap to start">
    A large circular microphone button appears. Tap once to start the session.

    <Frame>
      ![Hands-free microphone button](/images/features/hands-free-mic.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Speak your entry">
    When you see **"Listening..."** and the audio waveform animation, speak your entry naturally.

    The waveform visualizes your voice in real-time using your helper's theme color.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Listen to confirmation">
    Peanuts speaks back what it understood:

    > "Got it. Forty-two dollars at Whole Foods for groceries. Say yes to add, or no to cancel."

    The screen shows your transcript and pending data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond verbally">
    - Say **"Yes"** or **"Confirm"** to add the entry
    - Say **"No"** or **"Cancel"** to discard
    - Say **"Edit"** to exit and make manual changes
    - Say **"Exit"** to close hands-free mode entirely
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue or exit">
    After confirming, Peanuts says **"Done"** and waits for your next entry. The loop continues until you say **"exit"**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Handling Missing Fields

If required fields are missing, Peanuts enters a **"Held" state** and prompts you:

> "I got forty-two dollars, but I need a category. What category is this?"

You can then speak just the missing information, and Peanuts combines it with what it already has.

### Voice Commands in Hands-Free Mode

| Command                        | Action                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| "Yes" / "Confirm" / "Add it"   | Saves the pending entry    |
| "No" / "Cancel" / "Never mind" | Discards the pending entry |
| "Edit" / "Let me fix that"     | Exits to manual editing    |
| "Exit" / "Close" / "I'm done"  | Closes hands-free mode     |

<Note>
  Peanuts uses a calm, utilitarian voice (ElevenLabs "Sarah") designed for productivity - not a chatty assistant. Responses are brief: "Done", "Got it", "Held".
</Note>

## Field Dictation

For simpler use cases, you can dictate into individual text fields without AI parsing.

### How Field Dictation Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the microphone icon">
    Look for the 🎤 icon next to text input fields. Not all fields have this - typically longer text fields like notes or descriptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tap and speak">
    Tap the microphone icon, speak your text, and tap again to stop.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review transcription">
    The transcribed text appears directly in the field. Edit if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Field dictation is great for long-form notes or descriptions. For structured data with multiple fields, use Quick Voice Entry instead.
</Tip>

---

## Supported Field Types

Voice input works intelligently with different field types:

| Field Type   | How Voice Handles It                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Text**     | Direct transcription or parsed extraction              |
| **Number**   | Converts spoken numbers ("forty-two" → 42)             |
| **Select**   | Matches spoken words to available options              |
| **Date**     | Understands "today", "tomorrow", "next Monday", etc.   |
| **Checkbox** | Interprets "yes/no", "true/false", "checked/unchecked" |
| **Image**    | Skipped in voice entry - use form for photos           |

<Warning>
  **Image fields** cannot be filled by voice. If your helper has a required image field, use the Edit option from the voice confirmation dialog to add it manually.
</Warning>

## Credit Usage

Voice features use credits from your account:

| Operation                             | Credits Used |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Speech-to-Text (transcription)        | 10 credits   |
| Voice Entry Parsing (AI extraction)   | 1 credit     |
| Text-to-Speech (hands-free responses) | 15 credits   |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are credits calculated for hands-free mode?">
    Each hands-free conversation step uses credits:

    - **Your speech** → Transcription (10 credits)
    - **AI parsing** → Understanding (1 credit)
    - **Peanuts response** → Text-to-speech (15 credits)

    A typical single entry with confirmation uses approximately **26 credits**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of credits?">
    If you run out of credits mid-session:

    - Voice buttons show a **lock icon**
    - An upgrade prompt appears
    - You can still use manual text entry

    [Check your credit balance →](/credits)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reduce credit usage?">
    To minimize credit usage:

    - Use **Quick Voice Entry** instead of Hands-Free (no TTS credits)
    - Batch multiple items in one spoken entry
    - Use field dictation for simple transcription only
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Voice button shows a lock icon">
    This means voice features are restricted for your subscription tier or you've run out of credits.

    **Solutions:**

    - Check your credit balance in the header
    - Upgrade to a paid plan (Starter, Pro, or Team)
    - Purchase additional credits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'No speech detected' error">
    The transcription service didn't detect any spoken words.

    **Solutions:**

    - Speak clearly and at a normal volume
    - Check that your microphone is working (test in another app)
    - Move to a quieter environment
    - Ensure the microphone isn't covered or muted
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transcription is inaccurate">
    Speech-to-text may struggle with:

    - Heavy accents or unusual pronunciations
    - Background noise
    - Very fast or mumbled speech
    - Technical jargon or proper nouns

    **Solutions:**

    - Speak slightly slower and more clearly
    - Use the **Edit** option to correct mistakes
    - For proper nouns, spell them out or edit after
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI parsing extracts wrong values">
    If the AI puts data in the wrong fields:

    **Solutions:**

    - Be more explicit: "The **amount** is forty-two dollars"
    - Use field names from your helper in your speech
    - Use **Edit** to correct, then confirm
    - For repeated issues, consider renaming ambiguous fields
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hands-free mode doesn't hear my response">
    **Solutions:**

    - Wait for the audio waveform animation before speaking
    - Speak within 5 seconds (there's a max recording duration)
    - Tap the mic button to manually restart listening
    - Check that TTS finished playing before responding
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Microphone access denied' error">
    Your browser blocked microphone access.

    **Solutions:**

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Speak Naturally" icon="comments">
    Don't use robotic commands. Say "spent fifty bucks on dinner" not "amount fifty category food".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Include Context" icon="circle-info">
    The more detail you provide, the better the AI parses. "Coffee at Starbucks" works better than just "coffee".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Quiet Spaces" icon="volume-xmark">
    Background noise affects transcription accuracy. Find a quieter spot for better results.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Before Confirming" icon="eye">
    Always check the confirmation dialog. Voice entry is fast, but not always perfect.
