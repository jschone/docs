<Info>
  Widgets are interactive components that add real-time functionality to your helpers. They work independently of your data entries and can be configured to save values to fields.
</Info>

## Widget Overview

Widgets enhance your helpers with dynamic, interactive elements that go beyond simple data collection. Use them to time activities, track progress, visualize trends, and maintain streaks.

4. Tracks your best-ever streak

<Note>
  The Streak widget is read-only and calculates automatically. Just add entries to your helper, and your streak updates in real-time.
</Note>

## Chart Widget

The Chart widget visualizes your helper data over time with multiple chart types and aggregation options.

<Frame>
  ![Chart widget showing area chart](/images/features/chart-widget.png)
</Frame>

### Chart Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Area Chart" icon="chart-area">
    Smooth filled area showing trends over time. Great for continuous data like weight or mood.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bar Chart" icon="chart-bar">
    Vertical bars for comparing daily values. Ideal for discrete counts like workouts or meals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Line Chart" icon="chart-line">
    Connected points showing progression. Perfect for tracking metrics like steps or calories.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pie Chart" icon="chart-pie">
    Distribution breakdown by category. Use for expense categories or time allocation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Configuration

| Setting     | Description           | Options                     |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Chart Type  | Visual style          | Area, Bar, Line, Pie        |
| Time Range  | Period to display     | 7, 14, or 30 days           |
| Data Field  | Which field to chart  | Any numeric field or "Auto" |
| Aggregation | How to combine values | Sum, Average, Count         |
| Show Legend | Display chart legend  | On/Off                      |

### Aggregation Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sum">
    Adds all values for each day. Best for:

    - Total calories consumed
    - Daily spending
    - Minutes exercised
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Average">
    Calculates daily average. Best for:

    - Average mood score

  <Accordion title="Count">
    Counts number of entries. Best for:

    - Habits completed

### Pie Chart Behavior

Pie charts work differently from time-series charts:

- Groups data by the selected field's **values** (not dates)

- Displays horizontal legend below the chart
- Best for categorical data like expense categories or workout types

<Tip>
  Charts use a professional Teal/Gold color palette that automatically complements your helper's theme color.
</Tip>

## Saving Widget Values to Fields

Some widgets can automatically save their values to fields when you add an entry:

| Widget    | Saveable | Save To                |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Timer     | Yes      | Number field (seconds) |
| Stopwatch | Yes      | Number field (seconds) |
| Counter   | Yes      | Number field           |
| Rating    | Yes      | Number field           |
| Progress  | No       | -                      |
| Streak    | No       | -                      |
| Chart     | No       | -                      |

### How to Enable

1. Add a **Number** field to your helper
2. Configure your widget
3. In widget settings, select the field under "Save to Field"
4. Widget value is automatically saved when you add entries

<Tip>
  This is powerful for logging timed activities! Set up a Timer widget that saves to a "Duration" field, and every entry automatically records how long you spent.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose the Right Widget">
    - **Timing something?** → Timer or Stopwatch
    - **Counting things?** → Counter
    - **Rating quality?** → Rating
    - **Tracking toward a goal?** → Progress
    - **Building a habit?** → Streak
    - **Visualizing trends?** → Chart
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't Overload">
    2-3 widgets is usually ideal. Too many widgets can make your helper feel cluttered and slow down the interface.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine with Fields">
    Widgets work best alongside fields. A workout helper might have:

    - Counter widget for reps
    - Timer widget for rest periods
    - "Exercise" text field
    - "Weight" number field
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Charts Strategically">
    Add charts only after you have some data. They're most valuable when you've been tracking for a week or more.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Credit Usage

<Info>
  Widgets themselves are **free** and do not consume credits. They run entirely in your browser.
</Info>

The only credit cost is if you use AI features like Ask Peanuts to query data visualized in charts.
