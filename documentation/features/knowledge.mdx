## How Documents Are Processed

When you upload a document, Peanuts processes it through several stages:

| Stage         | What Happens                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Upload**    | File stored securely in your private storage        |
| **Parsing**   | AI extracts all text, tables, and structured data   |
| **Chunking**  | Content split into ~500 token segments with overlap |
| **Embedding** | Each chunk converted to semantic vectors            |
| **Ready**     | Knowledge indexed and available for AI queries      |

<Tip>
  Processing time varies based on document size and type. A 10-page PDF typically takes 30-60 seconds, while a large Excel file may take up to 2 minutes.
</Tip>

## Document Status Indicators

Your documents display status badges showing their current state:

| Status         | Icon | Meaning                                |
| -------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Processing** | 🔄   | Extracting content from your document  |
| **Learning**   | 🧠   | Generating semantic embeddings         |
| **Ready**      | ✅    | Available for AI queries               |
| **Error**      | ❌    | Something went wrong (retry available) |

If a document shows an error, you can click **Retry** to attempt processing again. Common causes include corrupted files or unsupported content.

## Using Knowledge with Ask Peanuts

Once your documents are ready, Ask Peanuts automatically searches them when answering your questions.

### Example Queries

```
"What's the price for the Premium Package in my pricelist?"

"Generate a quote for 50 units of Product X with installation"

"What materials do we use for exterior installations?"

"Summarize our refund policy for a customer who wants to return after 30 days"

"What are the specifications for Model ABC-123?"
```

### Citations

When Peanuts uses information from your knowledge base, it includes citations:

> Based on your **Product Catalog.pdf** (page 12), the Premium Package is priced at €2,499 including installation...

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **For best results with your Knowledge Base:**
</Tip>

1. **Use well-formatted source documents** - Clear headings and structure help AI understand context
2. **Prefer text-based PDFs** - Native text processes faster and more accurately than scanned images
3. **Keep documents focused** - One topic per file (e.g., separate "Pricing 2024" from "Terms of Service")
4. **Update when info changes** - Delete outdated documents and upload new versions
5. **Use descriptive filenames** - "Product_Catalog_2024.pdf" is better than "doc1.pdf"

---

## Limitations

<Warning>
  Keep these limitations in mind when using the Knowledge Base:
</Warning>

- **Maximum file size:** 20MB per document
- **Processing time:** 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on size and complexity
- **OCR accuracy:** Image-only PDFs and scanned documents may contain extraction errors
- **Internet required:** Documents are processed in the cloud
- **Private to your account:** Knowledge is never shared across users

---

## Managing Documents

### Viewing Documents

All uploaded documents appear in the Knowledge Base section with their:

- Filename and file type icon
- File size
- Current status
- Upload date

### Deleting Documents

Click the **trash icon** next to any document to delete it. This:

- Removes the file from storage
- Deletes all extracted chunks and embeddings
- AI will no longer reference this knowledge

<Warning>
  Deletion is permanent. The knowledge cannot be recovered-you'll need to re-upload the document.
</Warning>

### Retrying Failed Documents

If a document shows an error status, click **Retry** to attempt processing again. If it continues to fail:

- Check if the file is corrupted
- Try saving in a different format
- Ensure the file isn't password-protected

---

## Privacy & Security

Your business documents are handled with strict privacy:

- **Isolated storage** - Each user has a private storage bucket
- **No cross-account access** - Your knowledge is invisible to other users
- **Secure processing** - Documents processed via encrypted connections
- **Full deletion** - Removing a document purges all associated data
