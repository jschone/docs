## Tips & Best Practices

    If you typically schedule 30-minute or 1-hour slots, set a default duration to speed up entry.

    Even for virtual events, a location field (e.g., "Zoom", "Conference Room A") helps with context.

    After creating important events, tap "Add to Calendar" right away so they appear in your main calendar.
