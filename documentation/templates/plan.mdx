## Progress Tracking

### Phase Progress

Each phase shows:
- **Count** — "3 of 5 complete"
- **Bar** — Visual percentage
- **Status** — Not started, In progress, Complete

<Info>
A phase is "Complete" when all its milestones are marked done. "In progress" when at least one milestone is started.
</Info>

### Overall Progress

The plan header displays:
- **Total percentage** — All milestones across all phases
- **Current focus** — The phase with active work
- **Completion estimate** — Based on target dates

### Milestone Status Flow

Not Started → In Progress → Complete

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Not started** | Work hasn't begun |
| **In progress** | Actively working |
| **Complete** | Finished and verified |

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep phases to 3-7" icon="layer-group">
    Too few phases lack structure; too many create overhead. Aim for distinct, meaningful stages.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Make milestones specific" icon="crosshairs">
    "Launch website" is better than "Finish project." Specific milestones are easier to verify as complete.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set realistic dates" icon="calendar">
    Target dates keep plans accountable. Overdue milestones surface what needs attention.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review regularly" icon="rotate">
    Plans evolve. Review weekly to update priorities, adjust dates, and celebrate progress.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Start with phase one" icon="play">
    Don't try to detail every phase upfront. Focus on the current phase; future phases can stay high-level.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
