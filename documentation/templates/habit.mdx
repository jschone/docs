## Features

### Streaks

Habits automatically track **consecutive days**:

| Type | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Current** | Unbroken chain up to today |
| **Best** | Longest streak you've achieved |
| **At Risk** | Warning if you haven't completed today |

<Note>
Missing a day resets your current streak—but your best streak record is permanent motivation.
</Note>

### Calendar Visualization

The monthly calendar gives you:
- **Pattern recognition** — See which days you typically miss
- **Motivation** — Visual chains encourage continuation
- **History** — Browse past months to see progress

### Completion Percentage

See your consistency rate:

This month: 85% (17/20 days so far)

<Info>
Percentage only counts elapsed days—future days aren't included in the calculation.
</Info>

## Adding Detail Fields

Want to log more than just completion? Add fields in Edit Mode:

| Field Type | Example Use |
|------------|-------------|
| **Number** | Duration (minutes), reps, pages read |
| **Text** | Notes, reflections, what you learned |
| **Select** | Difficulty, location, type of activity |
| **Time** | When you completed it |

When fields exist:
1. Tap **Mark Complete** 
2. Form expands to show fields
3. Fill in details (or skip optional ones)
4. Completion saves with your data

<Tip>
Keep it simple—one or two optional fields max. The goal is to reduce friction.
</Tip>
