## Features

### Streaks

Trackers automatically count **consecutive days** with at least one entry.

| Streak Type   | Description                |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Current**   | Days in a row up to today  |
| **Best**      | Your longest streak ever   |
| **This week** | Entries in the past 7 days |

<Note>
  Missing a day resets your current streak to zero-but your best streak is preserved forever.
</Note>

### Charts

Calculated fields update automatically and display as read-only.
