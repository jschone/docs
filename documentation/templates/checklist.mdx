## Quick Start

    - "Daily store opening tasks"
    - "Pre-shift safety inspection"

  <Step title="Review suggested items">
    Peanuts pre-populates common items based on your description. Add, remove, or reorder as needed.

  <Step title="Start checking off">
    Tap items to mark complete. Progress bar fills as you go. Tomorrow, everything resets automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

### Daily Reset Behavior

<Info>
Checklists track completions **per day**. Each morning, all items appear unchecked again—no manual reset needed.
</Info>

| Time | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Today** | Shows current completion state |
| **Midnight** | All items reset to unchecked |
| **Tomorrow** | Fresh checklist, start again |

### Completion Tracking

When you tap an item:
1. Item is marked complete (checkbox fills)
2. Entry is saved with timestamp
3. Progress bar updates immediately
4. Item shows strikethrough styling

When you untap a completed item:
1. Entry is deleted
2. Item returns to unchecked state
3. Progress recalculates

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep lists focused" icon="crosshairs">
    Aim for 5-10 items per checklist. Too many items leads to fatigue and skipped completions. Create separate checklists for different contexts (morning vs. evening).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Order by sequence" icon="arrow-down-1-9">
    Arrange items in the order you actually do them. This creates a natural flow and reduces cognitive load.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use specific language" icon="text">
    "Take vitamin D" is better than "Vitamins"—specific items are easier to verify as complete.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Create context-specific checklists" icon="tags">
    Instead of one massive list, create:
    - "Weekday Morning" vs "Weekend Morning"
    - "Opening Shift" vs "Closing Shift"
    - "Home Office" vs "In-Office"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
