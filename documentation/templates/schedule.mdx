## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use categories wisely" icon="folder">
    Add a select field for categories (e.g., Produce, Dairy) to group similar items. This makes long lists easier to scan.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set sensible defaults" icon="sliders">
    If most items share a value (quantity: 1, priority: normal), set it as the default to speed up entry.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep primary field short" icon="text">
    The item name should be scannable at a glance. Use notes or description fields for longer details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular cleanup" icon="broom">
    Periodically delete completed items to keep your list focused. Use "Delete completed" for bulk cleanup.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
