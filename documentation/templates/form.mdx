|------------|------------|----------|
| **Required** | All types | Cannot be empty |

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep forms focused" icon="crosshairs">
    Only ask for what you need. Long forms reduce completion rates. Consider breaking into multiple specialized forms.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use smart defaults" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Pre-fill common values (today's date, default country) to speed up entry.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Order logically" icon="arrow-down-1-9">
    Group related fields together. Flow from simple to complex questions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide clear labels" icon="tag">
    Labels should be unambiguous. "Full name" is clearer than "Name."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use appropriate field types" icon="shapes">
    Don't use text fields for dates or numbers. Proper types provide better validation and mobile keyboards.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
