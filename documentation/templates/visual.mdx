## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent base photos" icon="image">
    For fair comparisons, use the same base photo when trying multiple items. Different lighting or angles make comparison harder.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Organize by category" icon="folder-tree">
    As your catalog grows, categories keep things manageable. Set up categories before adding lots of items.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Save favorites immediately" icon="heart">
    Like a result? Save it right away. You can always delete later, but regenerating the exact same result isn't guaranteed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Download for permanence" icon="download">
    Sharing links expire. Download results you want to keep forever or reference later.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Try multiple times" icon="rotate">
    AI generation has variability. If the first result isn't perfect, try again—you might get a better composite.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
