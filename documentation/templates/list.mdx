The **Dashboard Template** creates visual command centers that aggregate data from multiple sources into at-a-glance displays. Unlike data-entry templates, dashboards focus on visualization and monitoring rather than capturing new entries.

## Building Effective Dashboards

### Layout Principles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Lead with key metrics">
    Place your most important numbers at the top. Users should see critical data without scrolling.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Group related widgets">
    Keep related data together—financial metrics in one area, health metrics in another.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use charts sparingly">
    One or two well-chosen charts communicate more than five competing visualizations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include context">
    Show trends and comparisons, not just current values. "500" means nothing without "up 20% from last week."
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Patterns

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="KPI Dashboard" icon="bullseye-arrow">
    - 3-4 stat cards at top
    - One trend chart below
    - Progress bars for goals
  </Card>
  <Card title="Health Overview" icon="heart-pulse">
    - Weight trend chart
    - Exercise streak widget
    - Daily metrics counters
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project Status" icon="diagram-project">
    - Progress percentage
    - Tasks completed counter
    - Timeline chart
  </Card>
  <Card title="Financial Summary" icon="coins">
    - Revenue/expense stats
    - Pie chart for categories
    - Trend line for month
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuration

### In Edit Mode

Access via the **Edit** button to:

| Action            | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Add widget**    | Choose from available widget types   |
| **Remove widget** | Delete widgets you don't need        |
| **Configure**     | Set data sources and display options |
| **Reorder**       | Drag widgets to rearrange            |
| **Theme**         | Change colors and icon               |

### Connecting Data

Widgets can pull data from:

- **Same helper** — Fields within the dashboard
- **Other helpers** — Cross-reference your trackers and logs
- **Calculated values** — Derived from formulas

<Note>
  Cross-helper data requires helpers to share the same owner. You can't visualize other users' data on your dashboard.
</Note>

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with questions" icon="circle-question">
    Before building, ask: "What questions should this dashboard answer?" Design widgets to answer those specific questions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Less is more" icon="minimize">
    A dashboard with 3-4 well-chosen widgets beats one with 10 competing for attention. Prioritize ruthlessly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update frequency matters" icon="clock">
    Don't create dashboards for data that rarely changes. Dashboards shine when data updates frequently and trends emerge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mobile-first design" icon="mobile">
    Test your dashboard on mobile. Widgets stack vertically on small screens—ensure the order makes sense.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
