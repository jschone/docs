## How It Works

When an entry contains a **date field**, Peanuts automatically shows an **Add to Calendar** button.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Entry">
    Log an entry with a date field (e.g., appointment, deadline, event).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tap Add to Calendar">
    Find the calendar icon on the entry card or detail view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download .ics File">
    A standard calendar file downloads to your device.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open in Calendar">
    Your device prompts you to add it to your calendar app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
No OAuth or account linking needed—just download and import.
</Tip>

## What Gets Exported

The .ics file includes:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| **Event Title** | Helper name + entry summary |
| **Date/Time** | The date field value |
| **Description** | All entry data formatted as text |
| **Duration** | 1 hour default (or custom if configured) |

<Info>
If your entry has a time field alongside the date, both are included for precise scheduling.

## Date Field Setup

2. Add a field with type **Date** or **Date & Time**
3. Save the helper

All entries with that field populated will show the calendar button.

## Limitations

<Warning>
Calendar export is one-way. Changes made in your calendar app won't sync back to Peanuts.
</Warning>

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Export to .ics | ✓ Supported |
| Two-way sync | ✗ Not available |
| Recurring events | ✗ Each entry exports individually |
| Calendar OAuth | ✗ No account linking |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No calendar button visible">
    - Ensure your helper has a **Date** field
    - Make sure the entry has a date value filled in
    - Refresh the page if you just added the field
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="File won't open">
    - Check you have a calendar app installed
    - Try opening the file from your Downloads folder
    - On desktop, double-click the .ics file
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong time displayed">
    - The export uses your Peanuts timezone setting
    - Update timezone in **Settings → Preferences**
    - Your calendar app may also adjust for local time
  </Accordion>
