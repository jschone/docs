## Using Your Bot

### Commands

Every helper you create gets a Telegram command. Use it to log entries or switch context:

/expense 42.50 lunch with client /mood 😊 great meeting today /weight 75.2


### Natural Language

No need to remember commands-just describe what you want:

"spent 25 euros on groceries" "feeling tired today, 6 hours sleep" "remind me to call mom tomorrow at 3pm"


The AI figures out which helper to use and extracts the data automatically.

### Voice Messages

Record a voice memo and Peanuts transcribes it, then logs the entry to the appropriate helper.

<Info>
Voice transcription uses 1 credit per message.
</Info>

### Photos

Send photos of receipts, documents, or anything you want to track. Peanuts uses vision AI to extract relevant data.

| Photo Type | What Happens |
|------------|--------------|
| Receipt | Extracts amount, merchant, date, items |
| Document | OCR text extraction and summary |
| Food | Estimates calories and ingredients |
| Screenshot | Extracts visible text and data |

### Links

Share a URL and Peanuts analyzes the page content:

- **Recipes** → Extracts ingredients, prep time, instructions
- **Products** → Pulls price, name, description
- **Articles** → Summarizes key points
- **Events** → Captures date, location, details

---

## Smart Routing

Smart Routing automatically sends your content to the right helper without you specifying which one.

### How It Works

1. You send a photo, link, or voice message
2. Peanuts analyzes the content
3. If confident, it routes to the matching helper automatically
4. If unsure, it asks you to confirm

### Setting Up Rules

Go to **Settings → Telegram → Smart Routing** to configure:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Photo Rules">
    Route photos based on detected content:
    - Receipts → Expense tracker
    - Food → Meal log
    - Documents → Notes
    
    Or set a default action for all photos.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Link Rules">
    Route links by domain or content type:
    - `allrecipes.com` → Recipe collection
    - `amazon.com` → Wishlist
    - Any recipe page → Cooking helper
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Voice Rules">
    Route voice messages based on detected intent or set a default helper for all voice input.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Default Actions

For each content type, choose what happens when no specific rule matches:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ask** | Bot asks which helper to use |
| **Route** | Automatically send to a specific helper |
| **Create New** | Suggest creating a new helper |
| **Ignore** | Don't process this content type |

<Tip>
After you manually choose the same helper 3 times, Peanuts suggests creating an automatic rule.
</Tip>

## Telegram Mini App

Access your full Peanuts dashboard directly inside Telegram:

1. Open your bot
2. Tap the **menu button** or send `/start`
3. Tap **Open My Apps**

The Mini App gives you:
- Full helper management
- Entry history and editing
- Charts and statistics
- All features from the web app

<Note>
The Mini App adapts to Telegram's theme (light/dark) automatically.
</Note>

## Digests & Reminders

### Daily Digests

Get a summary of your tracked data delivered to Telegram:

| Digest | Default Time | Content |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Morning | 8:00 AM | Yesterday's summary, today's goals |
| Evening | 8:00 PM | Today's entries, streaks, insights |

Configure in **Settings → Telegram → Smart Routing** or send `/settings` to your bot.

### Reminders

Set reminders using natural language:

"remind me to take vitamins at 9am daily" "remind me about dentist appointment on Friday" "remind me to log weight every morning"

Or configure per-helper reminders:

- **Daily reminder** - "Don't forget to log your mood today!"
- **No-entry alert** - Notifies you if you haven't logged anything by a certain time

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot doesn't respond">
    **Check:**
    - Bot token is correct and active
    - Webhook is configured (green status in Settings)
    - You've sent `/start` at least once
    
    **Try:**
    - Tap "Reconfigure Webhook" in Settings → Telegram
    - Create a new bot with BotFather if token was compromised
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong helper selected">
    The AI uses context to pick helpers. To be explicit:
    - Use the command directly: `/expense 50`
    - Or specify: "log 50 to my expense tracker"
    
    Set up Smart Routing rules for consistent behavior with photos and links.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Voice messages not transcribing">
    - Ensure you have credits available
    - Check the audio is clear (minimal background noise)
    - Voice messages must be under 5 minutes
